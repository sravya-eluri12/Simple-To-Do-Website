Todo List Web Application
This project is a simple yet interactive Todo List web application that allows users to keep track of their daily tasks. It provides an easy way to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks from a dynamic list. The design focuses on user experience with a clean, minimalistic interface and local storage integration, so tasks persist even when the page is refreshed.

Key Features:
Add Tasks: Users can input new tasks into the list through a simple form.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them, which applies a strike-through effect.
Delete Completed Tasks: Once a task is completed, users can remove it by clicking the tick mark icon next to the task.
Persistent Data: All tasks are saved using LocalStorage, ensuring tasks remain intact even after a page reload.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, making it accessible on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Technologies Used:
HTML5 for the structure of the webpage.
CSS3 for styling and creating a user-friendly design.
JavaScript for handling task creation, deletion, completion, and managing local storage.
LocalStorage API to save tasks in the browser and ensure persistence.
This project demonstrates the use of vanilla JavaScript to manage dynamic content, DOM manipulation, and browser storage solutions, offering a practical tool for task management.
